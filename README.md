# Object Oriented Pascal's Triangle Library
Pascal's Triangle Library is an examle showing how mathematical library can be enhanced by object oriented programming paradigm.
In the library matematical abstract concept of Pascal's Triangle, its functionalities and properties, are entirely encapsulated in separate parent class PascalsTriangleMath.
Class OptimizedPascalsTriangle uses class PascalsTriangleMath to make more efficient Pascal's Triangle calculations. 
OptimizedPascalsTriangle knows nothing about how mathematisc of Pascal's Triangle is calculated.
OptimizedPascalsTriangle only knows how to handle matematics of Pascal's Triangle to make calculations more efficient.
## Examples
Examples of use are presented in tests in test folder
